## API Authentication

YouTubeRSS uses API key authentication for all API requests. Your API key acts as both identification and authorization for your account.

## Getting Your API Key

### Step 1: Access Your Dashboard

1. Log in to your YouTubeRSS account at [ytrss.xyz](https://ytrss.xyz)
2. Navigate to **API Keys**

### Step 2: Generate an API Key

1. Click **Generate Key**
2. Provide a descriptive name for your key (e.g., "Production App", "Development")
3. Click **Generate**

### Step 3: Secure Your Key

<Warning>
  - Never expose your API key in client-side code - Store it securely using environment variables - Rotate your keys regularly - Use different keys for different environments (dev, staging, production)
</Warning>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header using the Bearer token format:

```bash
curl -X GET https://ytrss.xyz/api/v1/poll/job/1234 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
